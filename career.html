<p> <h2>change career</h2>
  : In my mid 30s, i am going to change my job in 2023.
  i am plnaning to study at TAFE for 2years of diploma. Hopefully, after getting a certificate 4 
  i will apply a junior programmer position. Furthermore, i will study English again, from what i hear, 
  working as a progrmamer need to express ourselves and do a lot of presentations. so, i need to more
  improve my English skills. 
<ul>
<li>Back to TAFE(diploma)
<li>start studying English with tutor
</ul>
